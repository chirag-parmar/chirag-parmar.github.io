                                <div class="project-description">
                                    <p>India is an agrarian country with around 70% of its people depending directly or indirectly upon agriculture. However the condition of farmers in India is in shambles. The National Crime Records Bureau of India reported 5,650 farmer suicides. Farmer suicides account for 11.2% of all suicides in India. Contrastingly, The Agricultural sector in India shares 17.32% and Gross Value Added(GVA) is around of INR 23.82 lakh crores.</p>

<p>Our farmers do not know how to cultivate the land scientifically nor do they have sufficient knowledge to maximize the yield. Our product “SmartyPlants” aims to solve this problem using a subtle interplay of Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things and Blockchains. We use Microsoft’s Azure IoT Hub to collect real-time data of plant vitals like humidity, soil moisture and temperature etc.The real time data collected by the IoT Hub is sent as JSON to Azure machine learning studio for predicting the amount of resources required. If a plant requires resources then it purchases it via Ethereum blockchain for secure transaction. All of this is fully automated and requires no human intervention. After the predictions have been made,the data is forwarded to Microsoft Power BI for providing intelligent insights from our data. The insights from Power BI and Azure machine learning studio is presented in a user-friendly manner in our website.</p>

<p>A small fee is taken for every transaction made. This fee is used to provide continuous maintenance of the service provided. Stating that data is the new currency is no understatement as the data that we collect can be used by other organizations or individuals further improve upon this technology. SmartyPlants will marks the new phase of agricultural industry in India.

                                    <p>This project is a proprietary lock system for the whole of Next Tech Lab that uses face recognition using OpenCV and Microsoft Face API. The system recognises a face from the database and provides authentication. A failsafe mechanism is included which consists of a NFC reader, all members are given NFC tags and in the unlikely case of the face recognition system failing, members can still have free access to the lab using the provided NFC tags. The face recognition system and the NFC system are programmed on different development boards, Raspberry Pi and Arduino UNO respectively. This project was among the first ones executed at the Next Tech Lab.</p>

                                    <p>This project was aimed at providing a “Tony Stark” life to the user. Motion detecting sensors or PIR sensors allow you to sense motion, almost always used to detect whether a human has moved in or out of the sensors range. . They are small, inexpensive, low-power, easy to use and don't wear out. These sensors are integrated within the room and paired to a central device, Arduino, which processes information and toggles the appliances in the room. Apart from the luxury it provides it also ensures reduction in the energy consumption. This system is currently installed at Next Tech Lab, SRM.</p>

                                    <p>The prime objective of the project is to integrate an Artificially Intelligent system with the vehicle's electronic control unit so that the car can be brought to a stop as soon as the system senses driver fatigue. The application is not only limited to stop signs, but also to traffic signals, speed limit boards and other warning signs. The project uses a webcam along with a pocket sized computer(Raspberry pi) to obtain a real time video feed. It then processes the feed to detect various signs. On detection, the speed of the car is controlled accordingly. First, the system warns the driver, upon no response it overrides the control. The system is connected to Uber cab services to automatically order a cab for the driver, in case of fatigue. The A.I algorithm is embedded into the OpenCV module in the form of haar cascades(XML File). The system is aimed at reducing the number of road accidents which occur due to driver ignorance.</p>

                                    <p>With the start of Industrial Revolution Power tools became a very important part of the factory floor. Every day, millions of people go to work and operate potentially life threatening machines. More than a hundred thousand people are injured in a power tool related accidents every year. Our solution is an IoT based system that implements a wearable that connects to any type of machinery and permits access based on whether proper safety equipment has been worn. We use MQTT protocol to connect sensors on the power tools with sensors on the protective equipment. The hardware side exploits RFID technology to ensure use of protective equipment. The system is also equipped with a machine learning algorithm that detects the pain in user’s voice and calls for help.</p>

                                    <p>This project makes use of Microsoft's Speaker Recognition API to distinctly identifies the bike's owner.
					A Embedded linux system is used to record the bike owners voice and ignite the engine. This is done with the
					help of two relays. One of the relay fakes clutch while the other fakes the ignition button. The only drawback
					of this system was that it used too much power of the bike's battery making it unreliable for the long-run.
					The owner must enroll himself first so that the APi can extract the voice signature from his/her voice. After
					the voice signature is obtained it is compared with the current recordings voice signature to verify the owner.</p>

                                    <p>A crude war-robot designed to withstand the hardest hit possible. The robot is made out of 1.5mm thick
					stainless steel sheets making it "lighter"(realtive to other war robots) at the saem time stronger.
					It is important to note that the stainless steel sheets used are all recycled. Scrap metal thrown away by
					elevator manufacturers is recycled. A 7000mAh lead-acid battery is used to power this robot. Two L298N
					motor drivers are used to drive the motors at their highest torque. The physical design of the robot is
					intriguing. It works even after it is flipped over.</p>

                                    <p>This highly cost-effective project is built out of old DVD drives. It is very simple to build this hack. The stepper motors requires no extra fittings or fixtures. The servo plate could be directly mounted on a stand to get started. Arduino UNO and L293D's are used to control the stepper motor. Calibration is an unintersting task but took relatively less time to complete. The Arduino Uno system supports G-code for plotting with decent precision. Although, the plotting area is very small. </p>
